[features]
# Since this library does not make sense without also depending on `avian3d`,
# we are not replicating the `f32`, `f64`, `parry-f32`, and `parry-f64` features. 
# If you want to use f64 precision, add `avian_pickup` with `default-features = false` 
# and activate the f64-related features in `avian3d`.
